# Sudden Stratospheric Warmings

 A simple NCL's code to calculate the central dates of the SSWs following Charlton and Polvani (2007).
 
 1. The central date or event date of a SSW occurs when the daily-mean zonal-mean zonal winds at 10 hPa and 60N first change from westerly to easterly between November and March. 
 2. The winds must return to westerly for 20 consecutive days between events (to avoid counting the same event twice, roughly equivalent to the thermal damping timescale at 10 hPa). 
 3. If the winds do not return to westerly for at least 10 consecutive days before 30 April, the warming is a final warming
and is not included.
